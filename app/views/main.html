          <p> <b> This app will definitely make you say 'Oh Sh*t, Now this will solve my silly problem. </b> </p>
              
              <p> Its simple, you upload a pic and tell us the type of edit you want.. and we will do it. Ok listen, there are 
              many editing apps but we are not sure if they are neat and accurate as graphic designers do. Yeah, you don't have 
              to put your brain for editing. Just upload and leave it to us :)</p>
              
              <p> <b> And you know what? We shall do it in 30 Mins. Oh definitely. </b> </p>
              
              <p> We are not only helping you by editing a pic, but we are making them memorable. Because we know how much a picture
              means to you.</p>
          
            <p> We can do<b> EDITING, CUSTOMISED GIFTS, SKETCH, RESTORE OLD PCITURES. </b> </p>
